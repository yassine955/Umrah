# Testing Settings Functionality

## Steps to Test

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the settings page:**

   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/settings`
   - You should see the debug info showing your authentication status

3. **Test Profile Update:**

   - Fill in the "Full Name" field (required)
   - Add other optional information (phone, passport, address)
   - Click "Save Profile"
   - You should see a success message
   - The page should refresh after 2 seconds showing updated data

4. **Test Password Change:**

   - Enter a new password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Confirm the password
   - Click "Update Password"
   - You should see a success message
   - The form should reset

5. **Test Notification Preferences:**
   - Toggle any notification switch
   - You should see an immediate success message

## Expected Behavior

- **Authentication Required**: Page redirects to login if not authenticated
- **Form Validation**: Submit button disabled when form is invalid
- **Loading States**: Buttons show "Saving..." during operations
- **Success Messages**: Green success notifications with auto-dismiss
- **Error Handling**: Red error messages for any issues
- **Auto-refresh**: Page refreshes after successful profile updates

## Debug Information

The settings page now includes debug information in development mode showing:

- User email
- Session status
- Loading state

This helps troubleshoot any authentication issues.

## Common Issues

1. **"Auth session missing"**: This was fixed by using direct client-side Supabase calls
2. **Form not submitting**: Check that required fields are filled
3. **No success message**: Check browser console for errors
4. **Page not refreshing**: Check that the update was successful

## Success Indicators

- ✅ Debug info shows "User: [your-email]" and "Session: Active"
- ✅ Form submits without errors
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ Page refreshes with updated data
- ✅ Password change works and form resets
- ✅ Notification toggles work immediately
