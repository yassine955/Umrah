# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem

The settings page was experiencing hydration mismatches because:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) was trying to render authentication-dependent content
- Client-side authentication state didn't match server-side state
- This caused React hydration errors

## Solution

Implemented several fixes to prevent hydration mismatches:

### 1. Dynamic Import with SSR Disabled

```typescript
export default dynamic(() => Promise.resolve(SettingsPageContent), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <LoadingSpinner />,
});
```

### 2. Proper Loading State Handling

```typescript
// Show loading state while checking authentication
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// Only redirect after loading is complete
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !session) {
    router.push("/auth/signin");
  }
}, [session, router, loading]);
```

### 3. Conditional Rendering

- Debug info only shows when not loading
- Authentication checks only happen after loading completes
- Proper loading states prevent mismatches

## Benefits

- ✅ No more hydration mismatch errors
- ✅ Smooth loading experience
- ✅ Proper authentication flow
- ✅ Client-side only rendering for auth-dependent content

## Testing

1. Navigate to `/settings`
2. Should see loading spinner initially
3. Then either redirect to login or show settings page
4. No hydration errors in console
5. Profile updates work correctly

The settings page now renders entirely on the client side, eliminating hydration mismatches while maintaining all functionality.
